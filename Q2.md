## Observations

1. The down-sampled wav file clearly feels like its lacking fluidity - the cause of removing samples and effectively reducing sample rate
2. The up-sampled version hears like there is a distortion of sound and introduction of high frequency componenets in it - mainly caused due to aliasing
